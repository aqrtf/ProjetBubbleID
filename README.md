# BubbleID Project

This project aims to analyze and characterize bubble behavior from videos and images, using automatic detection, tracking, and statistical analysis tools. It relies on the Detectron2 library for detection and provides many scripts for analysis, visualization, and automation of processing.

This project is an improvement of the original BUBBLEID code developed by Dunlap et al. ([see](https://github.com/cldunlap73/BubbleID)).
It was first enhanced by Gio B. to detect bubble rising velocities and implement diameter extraction methods.
The current goal is to add new features for bubble detection, especially the tracking of coalescence history.
